Improvement of the encryption module's calculation speed using FPGA.  
Hardware module has a faster calculation performance. During the internship, I developed the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm module for encryption using [C language and FPGA](https://github.com/eoniboogie/HMAC).  
I sent packets to FPGA for the calculation job and then sent the calculated packets back to the CPU.   
Since the calculation had been calculated from the FPGA, the entire encryption speed improved by approximately 40%.
