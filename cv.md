## Project
### NTT DOCOMO (Tokyo, Japan) 2023.10 - Present
(Ex NTT Communications) Information Security Department / Security Management Office

I've been working in the security operation center. The main tasks are incident response, log analysis, and security tool improvement. My team uses SNOW for incident ticket management. I developed a system in which a ticket is automatically created in SNOW when an incident occurs. Also, I applied Microsoft Copilot to the ticketing system so that staff could save time for the basic investigation of the incident.

### NTT DOCOMO (Tokyo, Japan) 2021.04 - 2023.09
(Ex NTT Communications) Global Datacenter Service Department / Development Team

I worked as a front-end, and back-end developer.  
When I was in the front-end team, since the department was a global business, I usually worked remotely with team members in India. I led a small project with two Indian and one Japanese developers. The project was about re-designing all UI parts of the web pages due to a reorganization in the company. I managed the project and used Backlog for task management. The one sprint cycle was two weeks long and we had a retrospective every two weeks. I managed to complete the project in time and moved to the back-end team to experience server-side tasks.  
When I was in the back-end team, I used the Azure cloud environment for development and server management. I learned network architecture and how to secure information using key vault, network proxy, and tunneling. I used TypeScript for development and used Postgres for the database. Also, My team used Kubernetes and Docker for the development environment. 

### Toshiba Corporation (Tokyo, Japan)  2019.09 – 2019.10	
Infrastructure System R&D Team / Research Intern

Improvement of the encryption module's calculation speed using FPGA.  
Hardware module has a faster calculation performance. During the internship, I developed the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm module for encryption using [C language and FPGA](https://github.com/eoniboogie/HMAC).  
I sent packets to FPGA for the calculation job and then sent the calculated packets back to the CPU.   
Since the calculation had been made using the FPGA, the entire encryption speed improved by approximately 40%.
